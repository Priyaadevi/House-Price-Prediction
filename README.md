# 🏠 House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices based on various features such as number of rooms, square footage, location, etc. It uses machine learning techniques to train a model on housing data and provides accurate predictions.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze housing datasets
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Train machine learning models for regression
- Evaluate and compare models
- Predict house prices for unseen data
- 
## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Correlation heatmaps and feature importance
- Multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Model performance evaluation (R² score, MAE, RMSE)
- House price prediction for custom inputs
